New year, new resolutions.

This time, my resolution is writting blog.

It took me like a weekish to figure out the whole thing with Git/GitHub/Jekyll/Octopress and customize it with my geek taste.

Not 100% but good enough for me to build this blog.

Feeling a little embarrass that I haven't learnt Git for this whole time and stayed in the comfort room created by TFS.

I guess that is why we need new resolutions to break some old habits :).

Happy new year.
