I never used Ruby but heard a lot of nice thing about it.

[Octopress][1] is Ruby-based blogging framework for [Jekyll][2], which is [supported by GitHub][10].

It has several good things I like.

1. I can write blog in [Markdown][3] format.
2. I can have a lot of control of your blog.
3. Using it with GitHub means you can have verison control for your blog.

However, there are few things I don't like either

1. It uses [SASS][9] instead of LESS. They are similar tho.
2. It doesn't really use twitter bootstrap way to build the framework.
   (Well, I can change it, but it takes time. )

Here are some resource for Octopress beside the [official site][1].

1. Install and setup : [Creating a Github Blog Using Octopress][4] & [Setting Up a Blog With Octopress][8]
2. Themes : [3rd Party Octopress Themes][5] & [The ultimate Octopress themes & plugins collection][6]
3. Plugins : [3rd party plugins][7]
