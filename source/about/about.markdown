I am programmer. A learner of anything I'm interested.

Now I am really crazy about [AngularJS][0].

Basically the whole motivation to create this blog is I want to collect all small code examples I answered on [Stack Overflow][1].

I found somehow those examples are really helpful to myself. I think it might do the same to others.

<span style="color: gray">PS. Please spare me if you find some grammars error. I will do better after I find a perfect English grammar checker plugin :p</span>
